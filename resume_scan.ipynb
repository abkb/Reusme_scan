      "Manufacturing, Supply Chain and Operations Automation is seeking a Data Scientist to develop advanced analytic capabilities to support Intel's semiconductor manufacturing. The scope includes creating machine learning and analytic models and APIs to drive analytic discovery, and monitoring applications. The candidate will create predictive models to track factory performance (cycle time, throughput, product outcomes and yields) by analyzing historical data from such sources as parametric, image and equipment or factory signals data. The candidate will be expected to apply analytic and software solutions in a fast-paced and complex business environment and be able to communicate complex technical analysis to both senior technical and also non-technical staff.\n",
